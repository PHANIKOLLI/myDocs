     Container format:
         - The default contianer format is lib container and combine the following
         - Namespaces and control groups: (CGroups)
             - namespaces: limits what container can see, ex: PID, N/w interfaces/ interprocess comm, file sysytem and mount points
             - Cgroups: limits the cpu and memory block io and network
         
         - Union mounting is a way of combining multiple directories into one that appears to contain their combined contents.
         
     Images and continaners:
         - Readonly templates with instructions for runnning a Docker Container.
         - Hihgly portable can be shared , stored and updated.
         - One image can be based on other image with some additional customization.
         - Multiple container can access  the sane undelaying image and yet they have their  own data state.
         
     VM vs Containerization:
         - Docker containers are executed with docker Engine rather than  HYpervisor.
         - Docker containers are able to share the OS kernel, 
         - VIrtual machine uses hyper visor and each VM has its own kernel and OS.
         - Containerization is a abstraction of application layer that packages code and dependencies together.
         - VIrtualization is abstarction of physical hardware turning one server into many servers.
         - Containers take less space than VM's and is about 10's of MB
         - Containers take seconds to start , where as VM's takes minutes.
         - Containers are very light weight.
         - Containers support micro service architecture.


     Docker eco-System:

        - Service Discovery:
             - Generally load is blanced across many hosts.
             - Service Discovery enable app consumers to  learn about location of the devices providing the application.
             - Containers providing a particular application, register themselves so that other toolsknow about their avialbility.
             -  This makes scalble and flexible
        - Load balancing:
           - Distributes applicationtraffic across multiple backends.
           - Keeps a list of service backends with their IP address and port Location.
           - Continuous health Testing of backends to ensure they respond to requests correctly.
           
        - Orchestration:
           - Automated Configuration, Coordination andmanagement of the backend servers which collectievely provides a service.
           
           - Important responsiblities of Orchestration tools are:
               - Provisioning and deployment.
               - Scaling up/down containers.
               - Allocation of resources.
               - Movement of containers from one host to another.
               - Availability of the containers.  
               
           - Popular orchestration Engines: Docker swarm, Kubernetes, Apcahe MESOS/Marathon
           
           
     Docker Installation:
          - Docker support two types of Editions:
              - Community edition:  
                  - it has three update channels
                        - stable: lateset release for general availability.
                        - Test: Beta
                        - Nightly: alpha
                   - Ideal for small developers and teams expermenting with container based apps.
              - Enterprise edition:
                     -  ideal for production and enterprise developments and deploymetns.
              
          - Platform and requirements:
                - Supports all majotrversion of linux.
                - The os kernal mustsuuport the namespaces, cgroups(control groups) , appropriate storafge drivers ex - AUFS
                - Currently supprts 64bit architecture only.

         Docker instalation commands for centos:
         
         #sudo yum install -y yum-utils device-mapper-persistence-data lvm2
         #sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo
         ## saved the repo to /etc/repo.d/docker-ce.repo
         #sudo yum-config-manager --enable docker-ce-nightly
         #sudo yum-config-manager --disable docker-ce-nightly
         #sudo yum-config-manager --disable docker-ce-test
         
         #To see the list of avilable versions:
         #yum list docker-ce --showduplicates | sort -r  
         #sudo yum install docker-ce-18.09.3 docker-ce-cli-18.09.3 containerd.io
         #To install  latest version
         #sudo yum install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
         #sudo systemctl start docker
         #sudo systemctl enable docker
        
        mange docker as a non-root -user:
        
         - The docker daemon always runs as the root user.
         - Create a UNIX group called Docker and add users to it.
         - The docker group grants privilige equivalent to the root user.
         - Add your user to the 'docker' group.
             sudo usermod -aG docker <Username>
         - Ensure docker is ready.  
             ``` docker info ```
         - run a docker commadn without sudo
        Other ways of installing docker :
           - from rpm (redhatpackage managers)
               - manage upgrade manually
           - install from convinient scripts:
               - get.docker.com
           
           
        Docker containers:
          - docker attach vs docker exec:
             - docker run -it <imageName> # enteres into shell mod of container. creates only one session of shell (ps -ef)
             - docker attach <containerID> #creates only one session of shell 
             - docker exec -it <containreid> bash #creates two session of bash.
          - docker container name and hostname:
              #docker run -it --name webserver --hostname test -d -p 80 nginx
              #This above command automatically assign the hostport ,check with 'docker ps' command 
              #to see the allocated hostport no.
             
          - docker stats:
              #to see the docker mem and cpu utilization
              ```docker stats <containerID> ```
              

        Docker networking:
        
          - Three typs of networks exists on docker:
               - bridge n/w:
                  - defult n/w  172.17.0.0/16 
                  - we need to publish the private containr port using -p <portno>
                  - IP to the network in automatically assigned by DHCP internally.
               - host n/w: 
                   -  default no IP is assigned . it takes the host IP and the host port. directly you can connect 
                      to the continer just like an other process running on the hosts.
                   -  creates a container sam like a process on the hosts and shares the hosts network.  
                   -  There is no isloation between the host and the container.
                   - 'docker run -it --rm --network=host --name=nginx nginx;' # this command will run
                      if the default port is not used by any other process.
               - none:
                   - to disbale the network for docker container we can use none network
               
          #commands:
             - 'docker nertwork inspect bridge' to see the ip address of containers.
             - 'docker inspect <containerid>'  to see the network and other details.
             
          
          - How to remove none network and add bridge n/w to the container.
               - Start a container on the docker host.
                   'docker run -itd --rm --net=none -p 8080 tomcat'
               - disconnect the none nwetwork.
                   'docker network disconnect none <containerid> or <containerName>'
               - Add the bridge network and Inspect again.
                   'docker network connect bridge <containerID>'
              
           Overlay networks:
             - The network that are built on the physical network are called overlay network.
               'docker network create --driver=bridge  subnet=172.99.11.0/24 --gateway=172.99.11.1 new_bridge-2'
             - 'docker network prune' -prunes the custom networks which are not utilized by any containers.
          
          

        Docker Images:
           - Readonly templates for running docker containers.
           - writable layers gets created once the image is run as a container
           - Registry holds repositories
           - repositories hold images.
           
         commands for docker images:
            - docker images ls --filter "before=s3df1dsf53"  #shows the images downloaded before that image
            - docker images ls --filter "since=s3df1dsf53"  #shows the images downloaded AFTER that image
            
          Dangling images:
            - dangling images means creating new image with same name which exists already. Then the older image called as dangling image and it is saved as 'none'
            
             #command to see the dangling images:
                - docker images --filter "dangling=true"
             #command to print the output in specified format
                - docker images --format "{{.ID}}:{{.Repository}}"
             #Command
                 - docker images prune  #remves all unused and dangling images
                     
         Dockerfile:
            -  images are built using docker build command
            -  Build context is set of files at either.
                 - Specified location path.
                 - URL  - Git repository location.
            - The build is run by docker daemon not the docker CLI.
            
            - SampleDocker file
               .dockerignore file   - used to ignore file while building an image
               ARG CODE_VERSION=latest
               FROM <image>:CODE_VERSION
               #following commands support command type and shell type
                RUN <command> <flags> <parameters>  or ["command","flag","param1"]
                CMD <command> <flags> <parameters>  or ["command","flag","param1"]
               # when used with ENTRYPOINT , CMD provides the default parameters.
               # There can be only on CMD instrcution in the dockerfile. if we use multiple CMD then it takes the last CMD
                ENTRYPOINT <command> <flags> <parameters>  or ["command","flag","param1"]
               #ENTRYPOINT   sets the commands & parameters that will be executed first when a container is run.     
                ENV <key>=<value>
               #there can be one or more ENV variable set.
                WORKDIR <path>
               #we can use this multiple times in the docker file.
                ADD <SourcePath> <DestinationPATH>
               #add command adds files and directoried from the build environemnt to the image.
               #ex: ADD abc.zip /usr/share/tomcat/webapps/
                COPY <SourcePath> <DestinationPATH>
               #Difference between COPY and ADD is that it doesn't have extraction or decompression capabilities.
                
           # commands: to build image from a docker file
               docker build -t username/imagename:tag .
               
               docker image history <imageName>  # To see the layers of images an its memory size.
           # docker commit or docker container commit
              After making changes inside the docker container and if we want to persist the changes we can commit those changes using the docker commit.
              
              by default the container process will be paused while the image being commited.
              
              - docker contianer commit <imagename>   <username/image:tag>
              - docker container commit --message="A new image"  --author="authorname" <imagename> <username/image:tag>
           # The message we provided will be saved as the comment we can checkthat using the command   
               docker inspect image  <username/image:tag> | grep -i Comment

           DOCKER STORAGE:
           
              - Types of storage in Docker:
                  -  local storage for container:
                     - Storage provided for docker image run.
                     - Uses Storage Drivers to read filesystem layers from the contianres.
                 -  Persistence Data Storage:
                     - saving the data beyond the container lifecycle.
                     - Data is stored outised the container lifecycle.
                 - Static Image  storage:
                     - Storing images in the registry.
                     - ex: docker hub
